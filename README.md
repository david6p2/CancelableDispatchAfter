# CancelableDispatchAfter

## The Interview task was:

iOS developers have a "dispatch_after(when, queue, block)" Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) function they can utilize but once it's set up, these calls can not be easily cancelled.

Describe how you might implement a more convenient version of this named "cancellable_dispatch_after"  

## Build Instructions
